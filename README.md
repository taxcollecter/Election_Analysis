  1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
  2. Calculate the percentage of votes cast in each county.
  3. Calculate the total number of votes cast in each county.
  4. Determine the county with the Largest turnout based on popular vote. 
  5. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
  6. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won. 
  6. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
  7. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Election-Audit Summary
While this script can be used to successfully audit the turnout of our local elections, we also would like to propose enhancing the program to identify WHERE each candidate's support comes from by County. Doing so will highlight each candidates performance from a geographical pespective and underscore our auditing activities. From an intergrity perspective we would also propose adding additional years of data to the supporting dataset to track historical turnout over time. Doing so will expose outliers in turnout and identify any potential issues with voting integrity.
